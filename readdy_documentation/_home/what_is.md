The logo simulation mimicks a population growth process that frequently occurs in biology, e.g. bacteria colony growth. Sometimes, this growth process is subjected to spatial constraints, e.g. nutrients and bacteria are separated by a barrier. There are three different particle types, referring to that biological model:

- Type 1, the red “logo particles“, serve as the spatial barriers. They have been given an attraction potential between them and start in a position that resembles the ReaDDy logo.
- Type 2, the white “nutrient generators“. They can switch between a white ‘off‘ and an to a green an ‘on‘ state in which they can generate small “nutrient” particles.
- Type 3, the light blue “bacterium” particles. Bacterium particles can consume “nutrients”. This changes their state and appearance. The more “nutrients” they consume, the larger they become. First, after 2 consumed “nutrient” particles, they become blue colored “bacteria lvl 2“, after 5, violet colored “bacteria lvl 3” and after 7, large, purple “bacteria lvl 4“. When a 10th “nutrient” is consumed, the “level 4 bacteria” split up into four new small level 0 bacteria and the cycle starts again.

It is visible during the time course of the simulation, that the spatial distribution of the particles, their crowding inducing occurrence in masses as well as spatial constraints like barriers influence the growth of the bacteria population dramatically. What is true for this simplified example is ubiquitous not only in molecular and cellular biology but in multiple other fields.

ReaDDy has been designed to fit the modeling requirements of such processes: Particle (or agent) based reaction diffusion systems in which particle-particle interactions play an important role and where the systems are subjected to crowding or spatial constraints.
