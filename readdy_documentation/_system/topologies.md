Topologies are a way to include molecular structure in a reaction-diffusion simulation. 
A topology is a group of particles with fixed potential terms like bonds and angles between certain particles. 
Topologies consist of two ingredients:
- A connectivity graph between unique particles
- A lookup table for potential terms between certain combinations of particle types
