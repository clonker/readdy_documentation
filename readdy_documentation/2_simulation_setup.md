title: 2. Setup the simulation
---

The `system` object generates a `simulation` object, which determines _how_ to simulate the `system`.
This includes the diffusion integrator, the reaction handler, [observables]({{site.baseurl}}/observables.html).
The initial positions of particles are also set on the `simulation` object.
